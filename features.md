Things implemented so far:

- random map generation, with different level types(caverns, rooms, arena) and different level themes(forest level, big chasm room with dead trees, lakes and forest level)
- different map tiles with different effects(chasms, shallow and deep water, bush, etc.)
- FOV system
- noise generation (currently not used)
- light system (partially done, see issues, besides currently not used)
- fire spreading system (currently not used)
- inventory management and items
- monsters infighting
- animal monsters with basic AI
- humanoid monsters with a little bit more complex AI (they are able to pick up, equip and use items, they flee when badly hurt)
- combat system based on D20, with special effects for critical hits and critical misses
- special critical hits (bleeding, falling on ground, stunning your opponent)
- experience and progression system
- level bigger than screen, camera following player

Things I'm working on right now:

- optional tile graphics
- humanoid monsters should be generated with some basic equipment
