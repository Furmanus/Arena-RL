Things implemented so far:

- random map generation, with different level types(caverns, rooms, arena) and different level themes(forest level, big chasm room with dead trees, lakes and forest level)
- different map tiles with different effects(chasms, shallow and deep water, bush, etc.)
- FOV system
- noise generation (currently not used)
- light system(partially done, see issues)
- fire spreading system
- inventory management and items
- basic monsters (animals with simple AI)
- combat system based on D20
- special critical hits (bleeding, falling on ground, stunning your opponent)

Things I'm working on right now:

- humanoid monsters with more complex AI (they will be able to pick up, equip and use items, just like player)
- more critical hits (poison)
